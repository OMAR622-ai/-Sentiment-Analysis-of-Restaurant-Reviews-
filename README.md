# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Restaurant
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine and evaluate the sentiments and opinions expressed in textual data
Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
The dataset used for this sentiment analysis was obtained from a restaurant feedback survey conducted over a specific period. The survey collected comments and ratings from customers who had recently dined at the restaurant.

2.2 Data Preprocessing
Before conducting sentiment analysis, the textual data underwent several preprocessing steps, including:

a. Text cleaning: Removing punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols.
b. Tokenization: Splitting sentences into individual words or tokens.
c. Stopword removal: Eliminating common and uninformative words (e.g., "the," "and," "in").
d. Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form to standardize text.

2.3 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was performed using a machine learning or deep learning approach, depending on the dataset's size and complexity. Common sentiment analysis techniques include:

a. Supervised learning: Training a classifier on labeled data (positive, negative, neutral) to predict sentiment in unlabeled data.
b. Pre-trained models: Utilizing pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or VADER to analyze sentiment.
