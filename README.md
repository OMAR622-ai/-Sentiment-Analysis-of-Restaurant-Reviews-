Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to assess sentiments and opinions in textual data. This study applies sentiment analysis to restaurant feedback to extract meaningful insights.

2. Methodology
2.1 Data Collection
The dataset consists of customer reviews from a restaurant feedback survey conducted over a specific period. It includes comments and ratings from diners.

Lemmatization: Converting words to their base form for consistency.
2.3 Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment classification was performed using machine learning or deep learning techniques based on dataset size and complexity. Approaches include:

Supervised learning: Training a model on labeled data (positive, neutral, negative) to predict sentiment in new reviews.
Pre-trained models: Using models such as BERT, GPT, or VADER for sentiment evaluation.
